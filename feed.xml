After finally publishing posts, it only got a single comment at hackernews. I was so afraid, that I totally forgot how hard it is to even get feedback. The feedback is worth it! Don’t wait to get it.

<h2 id="rebranding">issue #14: <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebranding</a></h2>
<p>Naming a tool is a great way to ensure it’s quality. The initial reason was purely practical: 3rd party APIs and pypi require a name. But,</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">finding a pretty name increased my motivation for future features a lot.</p>
<p>I'm still super proud of the choice.</p>
<h2 id="create-dropbox-paper-and-link-to-task">issue #20: <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create dropbox paper and link to task</a></h2>
<p>After successfully releasing the progress bar-feature, I dug a bit deeper into the universe of 3rd party APIs. Taskbutler now was more than just one script to solve a specific problem.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1d5kci4ik1"><strong>Finding <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox Paper,</a> pure luck</strong></p>
<p>After successfully releasing the progress bar-feature, I dug a bit deeper into the universe of 3rd party APIs. Taskbutler now was more than just one script to solve a specific problem.</p>
<p>Finding <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox Paper</a>, pure luck</p>
<p>After using and disliking <a href="https://quip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quip</a>, I had high hopes for Dropbox Paper. I actually used it do brainstorm the Dropbox Paper functionality, since it always bugged my how limited the Todoist comment-functionality is.</p>
<p>A few years ago I tried <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlassian’s Confluence</a> + Jira for personal task tracking and knowledge management. It turned out pretty well, but it’s just a tiny bit too expensive and produces a lot of overhead. It’s also lacking a usable todo mobile app. Anyway…</p>
<p class="warn msg msg--info">The key to success: Easy to use SDKs</p>
<p>Dropbox Paper turned out to be a great tool to enhance normal tasks. After finding the <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Python SDK for Dropbox API v2</a>, it was pretty easy to implement the basic functionality of creating and linking papers. Unfortunately the paper-API is still in development and I had to work around some limitations such as searching for papers.</p>

<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img src="file://C:/Users/marvin/Dropbox/Publii/sites/slashlog/input/media/posts/6//feature-paper.gif" alt="" width="725" height="233">
<figcaption >in-app demo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The flow is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user creates a folder and an initial paper</li>
<li>Taskbutler searches for a task with a specific label name</li>
<li>checks if the task-title already contains an URL</li>
<li>If no URL is found:
<ul>
<li>it creates a new Dropbox Paper with the task-title as content</li>
<li>adds the URL to the Todoist task-title using Todoist’s formatting syntax</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">The main issue is keeping the link between task and paper alive.</p>
<p>Since no additional metadata can be stored within the task, Taskbutler relies on the URL in the task-title to be right.</p>
<p>Additionally, I stumbled on two weird issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>the API can't find an empty folder - the user has to place an initial paper inside the folder</li>
<li>the default permissions are set to public, which requires Taskbutler to always modify the permissions on new papers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="upload-template-to-dropbox-and-link-task-to-office365">issue #19: <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upload template to Dropbox and link task to Office365</a></h2>
<p class="msg msg--success">This feature is pretty wild!</p>
<p>It makes use of the Microsoft Office 365 integration in Dropbox.</p>
<p>Once Office 365 is connected to Dropbox, it is possible to open Office documents directly from the web-view of Dropbox. The file will then open right inside office.com(a web version of Word, Excel, Powerpoint).</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img src="file://C:/Users/marvin/Dropbox/Publii/sites/slashlog/input/media/posts/6//feature-office.gif" alt="" width="725" height="233">
<figcaption >in-app demo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The implementation is wild but super simple. It makes use of the fact that Dropbox URLs to Office 365 are always following the same schema:</p>
<pre>https://www.dropbox.com/ow/msft/edit/home/&lt;$FOLDER&gt;/&lt;$FILENAME&gt;</pre>
<p>Once one is logged into Dropbox and clicks on a link like the above, the corresponding file will open the web version of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>Since Todoist <a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195102-Text-Formatting-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allows URLs in tasks to be clickable</a>, the integration is almost seamless. To make use of this feature, Taskbutler will also upload a specified file to Dropbox when the feature label is found.</p>
<p>My main goal is to make it super easy to write a simple letter in case of e.g. cancelling a contract or similar things that require a default template. It saves a ton of time to select and edit a template once and using it with this feature.</p>
<p>This feature opens up a whole world of similar workflows. Maybe adding e-mail templates or even integration of online postage services that sends the finished letter once it’s marked as done.</p>
<h2 id="test-in-production">issue #27: <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test in production</a></h2>
<p>At this point in development, I noticed that the lack of tests is very problematic. I already added a devmode that runs without making changes, but I still relied on real-life tests with my personal account and during my personal usage. The functionality was still very limited and so were the test cases, but I clearly noticed the issue of missing tests.</p>
<p>Even today the test coverage is not very high. That’s why Taskbutler still fails very early and hard in case of any malfunction.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">Since Taskbutler modifies important user-data, it rather crashes completely than corrupts any Todoist data.</p>
<h2 id="log-rotation">issue #25: <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Log rotation</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is one of those issues, that are easily avoidable with proper testing. After a few days of personal usage, I noticed logfiles a size 50-100MB. This was due to a debug-log that generated tons of data. Adding rotation solved the issue </p>

                <p>Maintaining a tool requires time and effort. By naming a tool it becomes a thing; a thing that can be loved.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">By choosing a pretty name it becomes harder to abandon it.</p>
<p>You don’t want your baby to crash and fail during tests.</p>

<p>Naming can also be a hard part. Suddenly it becomes real - it’s a choice that requires responsibility. Naming forces you also to think about the future of your tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it need a domain for documentation?</li>
<li>Could a Github organisation be useful?</li>
<li>Docker, Twitter?!</li>
<li>Will it be listed on distribution platforms or stores like pypi?</li>
<li>Does it interact with 3rd party APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://namechk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">namechk </a>help to check availability on multiple platforms at once.</p>
<p>Finding the name can take time and so, can distract you from further development, but it shouldn't. Using name generators, browsing domain registrar websites and simply asking friends can help to accelerate the process.</p>
<p>Once a pretty name is found, wait a day, register accounts and just go with it.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d5hbi7ps3">bashblog - just a repo</h2>
<p id="mcetoc_1d5hbi7ps4">Finding a name for bashblog was pretty easy. It's written in bash, its a blog. There are similarly named projects, but since I've never had the intention to make a huge project out of it, it only needed <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/bashblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Github repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d5hbig675">taskbutler - a potential product</h2>
<p id="mcetoc_1d5hbig686">Taskbutler started as a simple tool to customize Todoist. It required API access from the beginning. Soon it also required access Dropbox and GitHub.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">When using APIs it's often required to register the app with its name.</p>
<p>Fortunately, companies want you to use their APIs; they will guide you through the process and usually provide clear hints and requirements. The <a href="https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v7/#brand-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todoist API Documentation</a> clearly states:</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">“Todoist” cannot be the first word in your application’s name. It can be used in the name of your app, though. For instance “x for Todoist” or “x with Todoist”, etc. This makes it clear that your application is created by you and not by Doist.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">You must clearly state that your application is "not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist” in your application description.</p>
<p>Quite obvious and understandable but important to remember.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d5hbki4c7">dream big</h2>
<p id="mcetoc_1d5hbki4c8">taskbutler started as todoist-progress. One problem, solved with one script. Since I had to rename todoist-progress anyway, I thought about future features a lot. It became quite obvious that it could be my potential first web app. Since domains cost only a few coffees, I soon registered taskbutler.org. The main reason I choose .org as TLD since .org not tied to a language or country.</p>
<p>It took a few days to rename todoist-progress to taskbutler. Check your <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/rename-refactorings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IDE for refactoring/renaming features</a> - it helps a lot.</p>
