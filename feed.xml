                <p>Using libvirt and virt-manager does reduce the number of known features that need attention, but it also doesn't offer you any help by providing useful features.</p>

<p>After setting up libvirt with virt-manager I followed some guides on performance optimisation - <br><br>Reading these guides made it clear that real performance optimisation can quickly get complex and requires deep knowledge of kernel features.</p>
<p>Turns out that management tools like oVirt provide a one-click solution to apply many optimization settings at once:<a href="https://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/virt/high-performance-vm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> oVirt 4.2 introducing High Performance VM profile</a> 😒</p>

                <p>It can be tempting to use fancy tools like XEN, VMware or Proxmox - but these tools also come with additional requirements, overhead and quite a large documentation.</p>

<p>And while these specialized tools can simplify complex infrastructures, the setup shouldn't delay the first milestone: a working host that quickly spawns new VMs.<br>Choosing the simplest tool for the job helps to reach a stable milestone faster.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info msg--highlight  msg--success">A stable state can be upgraded quicker than a feature-rich state that doesn't work.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfmj5lm10">Almost bare metal: KVM</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Even though container would use less resources, VMs are a bit easier to work with. I'm going with KVM, QEMU, libvirt and virt-manager on a Ubuntu Bionic LTS host.<br><br>I'm prefer a universal Ubuntu host over a specialized hypervisor/OS - like Xen or oVirt(which requires RedHat/CentOS) - simply because I know Ubuntu and the OS is still fully accessible(to install stuff in parallel).<br><br>Virt-manager doesn't look fancy, but gets the job done - and the </span><a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/sect-creating_guests_with_virt_manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-size: inherit;">documentation at RedHat is great.</a></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfmhiqvr1">apt install -y virt-manager</h2>
Installation is simple: <code>sudo apt install -y virt-manager</code> installs everything needed.<br>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfmhimde0">Shortcut: skipping dedicated DHCP/DNS</h2>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Setting up a special subnet, nameserver or even VLAN can be fun - but 10 VMs won't kill the home router.</p>
<p>This does depend on the internet connection, but typically a internet service provider does supply/require some sort of router which usually has DHCP and DNS enabled by default - why not just use these in the beginning?!</p>
<p>The AVM FritzBox router is the default ISP router in Germany and meets the requirements. It also provides the local domain<code>fritz.box</code> which - isn't pretty, but - works out of the box. The main goal is to get started quickly -<code>ssh $name.fritz.box</code> is fine. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">At the time the homelab requires a dedicated DNS/DHCP a global configuration management tool like Puppet should be in place anyway.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center align-center" src="https://blog.admindojo.org/media/posts/3/WmRbmf5.png" alt="Meme: It is always DNS" width="601" height="358"></p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Bonus TIL</strong>: The FritzBox doesn't handle duplicate hostnames very well. Check DNS and remove duplicates manually.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfmkhcuf1">Building bridges</h2>
<p>To use the existing DHCP server, all VMs require full network access - which isn't the default in most cases. Libvirt comes with a NAT network by default, which is nice to not interfere with the existing network, but it makes things complicated: NAT would require thinks like port-forwarding on the host and a reverse-proxy for web servers - maybe later.<br><br>For now, each VM should get it's IP directly via DHCP from the router - direct access via port 22 from anywhere within the network.</p>
<p>Nice side effect: <a href="https://netplan.io/examples#configuring-network-bridges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This setup only requires 5 lines in the netplan configuration.</a></p>

<p>After realizing that magnetic HDDs were good enough for our ancestors' servers, I decided to just start with what I have available rather than waiting for the day I'm able to afford my dream - SSD only, dual CPU - server(-farm).<br>A 1TB HDD in my primary workstation will do - since it will do all the hard work, any notebook will do for administration.</p>

<p>A homlab doesn't even require a physical network since most of today's infrastructure is virtualized anyway.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Start small and scale when needed is an important strategy to learn too.</p>
<p>Surely, the required hardware does depend on the goal, but a single (decent) PC will work in most cases.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Even an unoptimized Ubuntu VM will work great with only 1GB RAM/10GB HDD</p>
<p>and, as long not all VMs are running at 100%, it's totally possible to overprovision the virtual infrastructure(which means the VM could use 1GB RAM - but all unused RAM is available to the other VMs as well).</p>
<p>My main goal is to check out DevOps related tools and get a feeling of how much work it is to set up a proper infrastructure all by myself. It's much easier to test certain strategies - like load balancing - when a working infrastructure is just a boot away.</p>
<p>So, lets get started - the first boot is just a matter of a few screws👏</p>

<p>Naming a tool is a great way to ensure it’s quality. The initial reason was purely practical: 3rd party APIs and pypi require a name. But,</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">finding a pretty name increased my motivation for future features a lot.</p>
<p>I'm still super proud of the choice.</p>

<p>After successfully releasing the progress bar-feature, I dug a bit deeper into the universe of 3rd party APIs. Taskbutler now was more than just one script to solve a specific problem.</p>

<p>After successfully releasing the progress bar-feature, I dug a bit deeper into the universe of 3rd party APIs. Taskbutler now was more than just one script to solve a specific problem.</p>
<p>Finding <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox Paper</a>, pure luck</p>
<p>After using and disliking <a href="https://quip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quip</a>, I had high hopes for Dropbox Paper. I actually used it do brainstorm the Dropbox Paper functionality, since it always bugged my how limited the Todoist comment-functionality is.</p>
<p>A few years ago I tried <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlassian’s Confluence</a> + Jira for personal task tracking and knowledge management. It turned out pretty well, but it’s just a tiny bit too expensive and produces a lot of overhead. It’s also lacking a usable todo mobile app. Anyway…</p>
<p class="warn msg msg--info">The key to success: Easy to use SDKs</p>
<p>Dropbox Paper turned out to be a great tool to enhance normal tasks. After finding the <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Python SDK for Dropbox API v2</a>, it was pretty easy to implement the basic functionality of creating and linking papers. Unfortunately the paper-API is still in development and I had to work around some limitations such as searching for papers.</p>

</figure>
<p>The flow is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user creates a folder and an initial paper</li>
<li>Taskbutler searches for a task with a specific label name</li>
<li>checks if the task-title already contains an URL</li>
<li>If no URL is found:
<ul>
<li>it creates a new Dropbox Paper with the task-title as content</li>
<li>adds the URL to the Todoist task-title using Todoist’s formatting syntax</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">The main issue is keeping the link between task and paper alive.</p>
<p>Since no additional metadata can be stored within the task, Taskbutler relies on the URL in the task-title to be right.</p>
<p>Additionally, I stumbled on two weird issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>the API can't find an empty folder - the user has to place an initial paper inside the folder</li>
<li>the default permissions are set to public, which requires Taskbutler to always modify the permissions on new papers</li>
</ul>

<p class="msg msg--success">This feature is pretty wild!</p>
<p>It makes use of the Microsoft Office 365 integration in Dropbox.</p>
<p>Once Office 365 is connected to Dropbox, it is possible to open Office documents directly from the web-view of Dropbox. The file will then open right inside office.com(a web version of Word, Excel, Powerpoint).</p>

<p>The implementation is wild but super simple. It makes use of the fact that Dropbox URLs to Office 365 are always following the same schema:</p>
<pre>https://www.dropbox.com/ow/msft/edit/home/&lt;$FOLDER&gt;/&lt;$FILENAME&gt;</pre>
<p>Once one is logged into Dropbox and clicks on a link like the above, the corresponding file will open the web version of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>Since Todoist <a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195102-Text-Formatting-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allows URLs in tasks to be clickable</a>, the integration is almost seamless. To make use of this feature, Taskbutler will also upload a specified file to Dropbox when the feature label is found.</p>
<p>My main goal is to make it super easy to write a simple letter in case of e.g. cancelling a contract or similar things that require a default template. It saves a ton of time to select and edit a template once and using it with this feature.</p>
<p>This feature opens up a whole world of similar workflows. Maybe adding e-mail templates or even integration of online postage services that sends the finished letter once it’s marked as done.</p>
<h2 id="test-in-production">issue #27: <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test in production</a></h2>
<p>At this point in development, I noticed that the lack of tests is very problematic. I already added a devmode that runs without making changes, but I still relied on real-life tests with my personal account and during my personal usage. The functionality was still very limited and so were the test cases, but I clearly noticed the issue of missing tests.</p>
<p>Even today the test coverage is not very high. That’s why Taskbutler still fails very early and hard in case of any malfunction.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">Since Taskbutler modifies important user-data, it rather crashes completely than corrupts any Todoist data.</p>
<h2 id="log-rotation">issue #25: <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Log rotation</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is one of those issues, that are easily avoidable with proper testing. After a few days of personal usage, I noticed logfiles a size 50-100MB. This was due to a debug-log that generated tons of data. Adding rotation solved the issue </p>

                <p>Maintaining a tool requires time and effort. By naming a tool it becomes a thing; a thing that can be loved.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">By choosing a pretty name it becomes harder to abandon it.</p>
<p>You don’t want your baby to crash and fail during tests.</p>

<p>Naming can also be a hard part. Suddenly it becomes real - it’s a choice that requires responsibility. Naming forces you also to think about the future of your tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it need a domain for documentation?</li>
<li>Could a Github organisation be useful?</li>
<li>Docker, Twitter?!</li>
<li>Will it be listed on distribution platforms or stores like pypi?</li>
<li>Does it interact with 3rd party APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://namechk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">namechk </a>help to check availability on multiple platforms at once.</p>
<p>Finding the name can take time and so, can distract you from further development, but it shouldn't. Using name generators, browsing domain registrar websites and simply asking friends can help to accelerate the process.</p>
<p>Once a pretty name is found, wait a day, register accounts and just go with it.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d5hbi7ps3">bashblog - just a repo</h2>
<p id="mcetoc_1d5hbi7ps4">Finding a name for bashblog was pretty easy. It's written in bash, its a blog. There are similarly named projects, but since I've never had the intention to make a huge project out of it, it only needed <a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/bashblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Github repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d5hbig675">taskbutler - a potential product</h2>
<p id="mcetoc_1d5hbig686">Taskbutler started as a simple tool to customize Todoist. It required API access from the beginning. Soon it also required access Dropbox and GitHub.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">When using APIs it's often required to register the app with its name.</p>
<p>Fortunately, companies want you to use their APIs; they will guide you through the process and usually provide clear hints and requirements. The <a href="https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v7/#brand-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todoist API Documentation</a> clearly states:</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">“Todoist” cannot be the first word in your application’s name. It can be used in the name of your app, though. For instance “x for Todoist” or “x with Todoist”, etc. This makes it clear that your application is created by you and not by Doist.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">You must clearly state that your application is "not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist” in your application description.</p>
<p>Quite obvious and understandable but important to remember.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d5hbki4c7">dream big</h2>
<p id="mcetoc_1d5hbki4c8">taskbutler started as todoist-progress. One problem, solved with one script. Since I had to rename todoist-progress anyway, I thought about future features a lot. It became quite obvious that it could be my potential first web app. Since domains cost only a few coffees, I soon registered taskbutler.org. The main reason I choose .org as TLD since .org not tied to a language or country.</p>
<p>It took a few days to rename todoist-progress to taskbutler. Check your <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/rename-refactorings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IDE for refactoring/renaming features</a> - it helps a lot.</p>
