The file will then open right inside office.com(a web version of Word, Excel, Powerpoint).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"file://C:/Users/marvin/Dropbox/Publii/sites/slashlog/input/media/posts/6//feature-office.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"725\" height=\"233\">\n<figcaption >in-app demo</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The implementation is wild but super simple. It makes use of the fact that Dropbox URLs to Office 365 are always following the same schema:</p>\n<pre>https://www.dropbox.com/ow/msft/edit/home/&lt;$FOLDER&gt;/&lt;$FILENAME&gt;</pre>\n<p>Once one is logged into Dropbox and clicks on a link like the above, the corresponding file will open the web version of Microsoft Office.</p>\n<p>Since Todoist <a href=\"https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195102-Text-Formatting-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allows URLs in tasks to be clickable</a>, the integration is almost seamless. To make use of this feature, Taskbutler will also upload a specified file to Dropbox when the feature label is found.</p>\n<p>My main goal is to make it super easy to write a simple letter in case of e.g. cancelling a contract or similar things that require a default template. It saves a ton of time to select and edit a template once and using it with this feature.</p>\n<p>This feature opens up a whole world of similar workflows. Maybe adding e-mail templates or even integration of online postage services that sends the finished letter once it’s marked as done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"test-in-production\">issue #27: <a href=\"https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Test in production</a></h2>\n<p>At this point in development, I noticed that the lack of tests is very problematic. I already added a devmode that runs without making changes, but I still relied on real-life tests with my personal account and during my personal usage. The functionality was still very limited and so were the test cases, but I clearly noticed the issue of missing tests.</p>\n<p>Even today the test coverage is not very high. That’s why Taskbutler still fails very early and hard in case of any malfunction.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Since Taskbutler modifies important user-data, it rather crashes completely than corrupts any Todoist data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"log-rotation\">issue #25: <a href=\"https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler/issues/25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Log rotation</a></h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is one of those issues, that are easily avoidable with proper testing. After a few days of personal usage, I noticed logfiles a size 50-100MB. This was due to a debug-log that generated tons of data. Adding rotation solved the issue </p>",

It required API access from the beginning. Soon it also required access Dropbox and GitHub.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">When using APIs it's often required to register the app with its name.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, companies want you to use their APIs; they will guide you through the process and usually provide clear hints and requirements. The <a href=\"https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v7/#brand-usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Todoist API Documentation</a> clearly states:</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">“Todoist” cannot be the first word in your application’s name. It can be used in the name of your app, though. For instance “x for Todoist” or “x with Todoist”, etc. This makes it clear that your application is created by you and not by Doist.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">You must clearly state that your application is \"not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist” in your application description.</p>\n<p>Quite obvious and understandable but important to remember.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d5hbki4c7\">dream big</h2>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1d5hbki4c8\">taskbutler started as todoist-progress. One problem, solved with one script. Since I had to rename todoist-progress anyway, I thought about future features a lot. It became quite obvious that it could be my potential first web app. Since domains cost only a few coffees, I soon registered taskbutler.org. The main reason I choose .org as TLD since .org not tied to a language or country.</p>\n<p>It took a few days to rename todoist-progress to taskbutler. Check your <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/rename-refactorings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IDE for refactoring/renaming features</a> - it helps a lot.</p>",
